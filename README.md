The path was clear, and things were falling in place perfectly. Until she showed up.I never meant to fall for my friend?s little sister and by the time I realized I had, it was too late. I am a man in love with a girl ? who is in love with someone else. But I can?t compete with a ghost, and her heart was buried along side the boy she gave it to. The father of her unborn son. Instead of fighting for something she?s unable to give, I do my best to be her friend, but then her little man comes along, and changes everything.She says I should walk away, focus on my love for football, but I can?t, because what she doesn?t understand is I have a new dream now. One that begins and ends with them. Release Date Oct 1, 2024</p>
